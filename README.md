Web Feature Service
===================
The [OGC Web Feature Service (WFS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) 2.0 interface for the 3D City Database enables web-based access to the city objects stored in the database. WFS clients can directly connect to this standardized and open interface for requesting 3D content across the web using platform-independent calls. Users of the 3D City Database are therefore no longer limited to using the Importer/Exporter tool for data retrieval. The Web feature services allows clients to only retrieve the city objects they are seeking, rather than retrieving a file that contains the data they are seeking and possibly much more.
